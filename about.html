         <p>After hard times in Thailand my parents were able to finally move to America. They have pursued the <i>American Dream</i> and now cook the best Thailand dishes on the East Coast. Our very first was Al Capone and his family, boy was that a wacky time!? Come on in and taste years of culinary experience, culture, and love in every dish. 
            <p><sub>please help they are extorting the family and the rice hasn't been enough payment these days. Please buy the Pad Thai.</sub> </p>
